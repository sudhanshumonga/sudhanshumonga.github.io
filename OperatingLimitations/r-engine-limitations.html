    <p class="shortdesc">While you can safely operate the engines at up to 100% of the power level, there is
        also a requirement to operate at a range of powers levels.</p><div><p class="p">An upper range of 109% has
                been set as a temporary override to the engine limits. This may be run for up to 600
                seconds of operation. </p><div class="note caution note-caution"><span class="note--title">CAUTION:</span> <p class="p">Actual flight performance has not
                    been tested beyond time and power levels for more than 600 seconds. Exceeding
                    this can permanently damage the vehicle.</p></div><div class="p">The primary computer
                system monitors the temperature of the turbopump components including:<ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li"><p class="p">high pressure fuel pump</p></li>
                    <li class="li"><p class="p">high pressure oxidizer</p></li>

                shutdown. If the captain has manually prevented this the temperature can be forced
                to exceed limits.</p></div>
