There are many escape systems based on the type of operation you plan.         You can get out early at the launch site, escape the main cabin, or even eject safely during         re-entry if needed.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../Systems/c-crew-and-passenger-system">Crew and passenger system</a></strong><br>Many pieces of equipment and systems that the crew and passengers use are only         covered here, and not in other parts of the manual. This is largely due to the nature of         these parts. They are largely just to make the crew comfortable. They donâ€™t play a specific         role in the ongoing operation of the vehicle.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../Systems/c-landing-system">Landing system</a></strong><br>The approach to landing is to descend in the same way that any conventional aircraft.         That is, the vehicle descends through the air, approaches a landing strip, and makes a         normal landing.</li></ul></nav></div>
